# hot dog or not ?!

## Description
I found this weird web service on shodan, hosted on an embedded device somewhere in Malta.
Wonder if there is more to this than just recognizing hot dogs on images... 
Sadly I only have this one image of hot dog, can I use it to make model behave differently?

## Hint
I wonder if we can make the model missclassify the image as the flag?
