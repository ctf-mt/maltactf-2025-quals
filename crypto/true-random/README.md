# True Random

## Description
So it seems I need to transfer a flag or something. Fortunately - no cryptographer can break OTP! Unfortunately... my cat may have shuffled my otp codes around. Should be fine though, we have a few quantum circuits conveniently shared between us that we can use as our checksums! Surely the checksum of a random output won't let you break my OTP!

## Hint
I hear quantum's all about some special kinda matrixes. Scary stuff - I don't know what a number is.
