# Amped Up

The files in `dist` are a compiled version of [webamp-modern](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/tree/b761f81c217e9738d3716b45742bf04a21ce48f3/packages/webamp-modern), commit b761f81c217e9738d3716b45742bf04a21ce48f3. Some minor changes were made to `WebampModern.js` and `SkinEngine_WAL.js` to make distribution easier. These changes do not affect the challenge. For transparency, diffs for these changes are provided in the `*-changes.diff` files.

An admin bot is used for this challenge. Once you have a skin capable of extracting the flag installed by the `admin-bot.js`, upload it to a file host (such as [catbox](https://catbox.moe)) and submit the publicly accessible skin URL to the admin bot.
